</p>  

I’m an experienced full-stack developer who has ardent passion towards building infrastructure and helping manage and create extensive projects. I’ve always been interested in working with web technologies and embedded systems and I posses special aptitude towards P2P based applications.

Over the last 4 years, I have successfully completed several significant projects spanning a wide range of problem domains and is professionally capable of applying my skill-set to various challenging issues. I have taken on the role of head developer, team member, solo programmer and is relied on to function effectively in all situations and work environments. I love writing here in my free time, I also love having pointless discussions about politics and economics ♥

I'm usually available for freelance/contract gigs, if you're interested in working with me give me a ping at hayzam@hayzam.com
